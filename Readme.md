***This is an RTOS based Project which aims at reading ADXL345 Accelerometer sensor data and post it to a node server as a json string running locally on the sytem***



1) Microcontroller used - NoduMCU-ESP32

  The ESP32 is a powerful 32 bit microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi, full TCP/IP stack for internet connection and Bluetooth. Due to the low cost combined with great power and   the opportunity to connect the ESP32 to many other electronic devices, the microcontroller is well suited for IoT projects.

2) Sensor               - ADXL345 Accelerometer sensor 

  The ADXL345 is a small, thin, ultralow power, 3-axis accelerometer with high resolution (13-bit) measurement at up to Â±16 g. Digital output data is formatted as 16-bit twos complement and is accessible through either a SPI (3- or 4-wire) or I2C digital interface
  
3) Server               - Nodejs server running locally on the system 

  Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
  Node.js allows the creation of Web servers and networking tools using JavaScript and a collection of modules that handle various core functionalities. Modules are provided for     file system I/O, networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL, or UDP), binary data (buffers), cryptography functions, data streams, and other core functions.
